            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Subject-2003 (designated "The Alamban") is a 22-year-old humanoid specimen exhibiting minimal muscle mass and irregular nutritional patterns. Preliminary analysis suggests mild malnutrition due to caloric prioritization of snacks over meals. The subject is currently <span class="highlight">an IT student demonstrating high aptitude for digital manipulation</span>. Observable traits include black hair and a consistent preference for dark-colored attire to minimize visual detection.
            </p>

            <p>
                Subject-2003 was first documented at a 7/11 convenience store following reports of an agitated individual exhibiting hunger-driven bargaining behavior. Upon contact, the subject was observed biting a sandwich while demanding a price reduction due to perceived overvaluation.
            </p>

            <h3>Special Containment Procedures</h3>
            <p>
                Subject-2003 is to be maintained in a standard residential chamber located in <span class="redacted">Poblacion, Opol</span>. <span class="highlight">A steady supply of sandwiches and high-speed internet access is required to maintain docility</span>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During “Hunger Events,” the subject may migrate toward the nearest 7/11 checkpoint. Personnel are advised not to disrupt the "Procrastination Cycle" unless a deadline is within two hours, at which point the Subject enters a hyper-productive frenzy state.
            </p>

            <h3>Behavioral Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                Subject engages in 4–6 hours of daily “Digital Foraging,” navigating online information networks. Notable proficiencies include Video Games (Primary) and Coding (Secondary). 
            </p>

            <h3>Addendum 2003-α</h3>
            <blockquote class="note">
                <strong>Researcher Note:</strong> Subject productivity increases by 300% when exposure to imminent deadlines is detected. Long-term containment efficiency remains under evaluation. It is recommended to provide coffee at 2-hour intervals.
            </blockquote>
